# forestspy

spy on your random forests -- a little tiny library for investigating scikit-learn random forests models. requires a whole bunch of things; there's a requirements.txt here that's meant to hint at the dependencies but this is really experimental code. Look at [the notebook](https://github.com/jvns/forestspy/blob/master/inspecting%20random%20forest%20models.ipynb) for usage examples.
